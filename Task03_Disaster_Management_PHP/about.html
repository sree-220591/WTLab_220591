            <p class="about-text">
                HAnds iN neeD is a disaster management and response portal created to support individuals and communities during emergency situations. The platform focuses on providing reliable information ,coordinated assistance, and transparent support mechanisms when timely help is most critical.
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                Our goal is to build a system that people can rely on during times of crisis,
                especially when access to resources, communication, or immediate help is limited.
                By combining technology with a humanitarian approach, Hands In Need aims to bridge
                the gap between those in need and those willing to help.
